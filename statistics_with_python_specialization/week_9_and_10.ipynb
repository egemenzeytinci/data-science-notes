    "#### Fitting a Multilevel Model\n",
    "This analysis will be focusing on a longitudinal study that was conducted on children with autism<sup>1</sup>. We will be looking at several variables and exploring how different factors interact with the socialization of a child with autism as they progress throughout the beginning stages of their life.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variables we have from the study are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- AGE is the age of a child which, for this dataset, is between two and thirteen years \n",
    "- VSAE measures a child's socialization \n",
    "- SICDEGP is the expressive language group at age two and can take on values ranging from one to three. Higher values indicate more expressive language.\n",
    "- CHILDID is the unique ID that is given to each child and acts as their identifier within the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first be fitting a multilevel model with explicit random effects of the children to account for the fact that we have repeated measurements on each child, which introduces correlation in our observations.\n",

Overall, the two GEE models are mostly similar and both exhibit standard errors for parameters that are slightly larger than each of their corresponding values in the OLS model. The multilevel model has the largest standard error for the age coefficient, but the smallest standard error for the intercept. Overall, we see that we would make similar inferences regarding the importance of these fixed effects, but remember that we need to interpret the multilevel models estimates conditioning on a given child. For example, considering the age coefficient in the multilevel model, we would say that as age increases by one year *for a given child* in the first expressive language group, VSAE is expected to increase by 2.73. In the GEE and OLS models, we would say that as age increases by one year *in general*, the average VSAE is expected to increase by 2.60."

    "##### Introduction to clustered data  \n",
    "\n",
    "One common reason that data are dependent is that the data values were collected in clusters.  This essentially means that the population was partitioned into groups, a limited number of these groups were somehow selected, and then a limited number of individuals were selected from each of the selected groups.  In a proper survey, there is a well-planned design, in which both the groups, and the individuals within groups, are selected randomly.  The goal in doing this is to maximize the chances that the sample is representative of the population of interest in all relevant ways.  But many other data sets exhibit clustering structure, even when the data collection was not so carefully planned.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of how the clustering in the sample arose, it is likely to be the case that observations within a cluster are more similar to observations in different clusters.  To make this concrete, note that clustering is often geographic.  Data may be collected by visiting several locations, then recruiting participants within each location. People within a location may share similarities, for example in demography and lifestyle, or they may share environmental circumstances such as climate.  When we have clustered data, it is usually advisable to account for this in the analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Clustering structure in NHANES  \n",
    "\n",
    "The detailed process of collecting data for a study like NHANES is very complex, so we will simplify things substantially here (more details can be found [here](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) but are not needed for this course). Roughly speaking, in NHANES the data are collected by selecting a limited number of counties in the US, then selecting subregions of these counties, then selecting people within these subregions.  Since counties are geographically constrained, it is expected that people within a county are more similar to each other than they are to people in other counties.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If we could obtain the county id where each NHANES participant resides, we could directly study this clustering structure.  However for privacy reasons this information is not released with the data. Instead, we have access to \"masked variance units\" (MVUs), which are formed by combining subregions of different counties into artificial groups that are not geographically contiguous.  While the MVUs are not the actual clusters of the survey, and are not truly contiguous geographic regions, they are deliberately selected to mimic these things, while minimizing the risk that a subject can be \"unmasked\" in the data.  For the remainder of this notebook, we will treat the MVUs as clusters, and explore the extent to which they induce correlations in some of the NHANES variables that we have been studying.  The MVU identifiers can be obtained by combining the `SDMVSTRA` and `SDMVPSU` identifiers, which we do next:"

Since we know that there is dependence in these data that is driven by clustering, the OLS approach is not theoretically justified (the OLS parameter estimates remain in meaningful, but the standard errors do not).

One thing to emphasize in doing this is that the GLM and GEE are both legitimate estimators of the marginal mean structure here.

    "As expected, the results show that the GLM and the GEE give very similar estimates for the regression parameters.  However the standard errors obtained using GEE are somewhat larger than those obtained using GLM.  This indicates that GLM understates the uncertainty in the estimated mean structure, which is a direct consequence of it ignoring the dependence structure.  The GEE results do not suffer from this weakness.  To the extent that the GLM and GEE parameter estimates differ, this is due to GEE attempting to exploit the dependence structure to obtain more efficient (i.e. more accurate) estimates of the model parameters. Thus, in summary, we can view GEE as trying to accomplish three things above and beyond what we obtain from GLM:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- GEE gives us insight into the dependence structure of the data  \n",
    "- GEE uses the dependence structure to obtain meaningful standard errors of the estimated model parameters.  \n",

Finally, with regard to the third  point, GEE should in general have an efficiency advantage over GLM, but GLM estimates remain \"valid\" and cannot be completely dismissed solely on this basis.  \n",

    "Multilevel modeling is a large topic, and some aspects of it are quite advanced.  Here, we will explore one facet of multilevel modeling -- using it as an alternative way to accommodate dependence in clustered data.  In this sense, multilevel modeling is an alternative to the marginal regression analysis demonstrated above.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the setting of linear regression, mutilevel models and marginal models are similar in most ways (note that more substantial differences between marginal and multilevel models emerge in the case of logistic regression, and in other generalized linear or nonlinear models). Multilevel models and marginal models estimate the same population target, but represent this target in different ways, and utilize different estimation procedures.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A multilevel model is usually expressed in terms of *random effects*. These are variables that we do not observe, but that we can nevertheless incorporate into a statistical model.  We cannot get into all of the technical details here, but it is important to understand that while these random effects are not observed, their presence can be inferred through the data, as long as each random effect is modeled as influencing at least two observations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the present setting, we are focusing only on dependence that arises through a single level of clustering.  To put this in the context of multilevel modeling, we can imagine that each cluster has a random effect that is shared by all observations in that cluster.  For example, if SBP tends to be around 0.5 units higher in one cluster, then the random effect for that cluster would be 0.5, and it would add to the predicted SBP for every observation in the cluster."

Above we found some evidence that such clustering is present in the data.  Next we consider a more subtle form of cluster effect, in which the slope for a specific covariate varies from cluster to cluster.  This is called a *random slopes model*.  To demonstrate, below we fit a model in which SBP has cluster-specific intercepts, and cluster-specific slopes for the age covariate.  That is, we ask whether the rate at which blood pressure increases with age might differ from one cluster to the next.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We fit two variations on this model.  In the first model, the cluster-specific intercepts and slopes are independent random variables.  That is, a cluster with unusually high SBP is no more or less likely to have unusually rapid increase of SBP with age.  Note that when working with random slopes, it is usually advisable to center any covariate which has a random slope.  This does not change the fundamental interpretation of the model, but it does often result in models that converge faster and more robustly.  Here we center within each cluster, although it is also common to center in the entire dataset, rather than centering separately by cluster."

These cluster-specific fluctuations are added/subtracted from the fixed effect for age, which is 0.467.  Thus, in some clusters SBP may increase by around `0.467 + 0.06 = 0.527` mm/Hg per year, while in other clusters SBP may increase by only around `0.467 - 0.06 = 0.407` mm/Hg per year.

In this case, however, the algorithm seems to have converged to a point just short of the boundary.  \n",
