## âš“ Introduction

First of all, I'd like to point out that these notes can be subjective because I took them while reading, listening or
watching the course materials. You can find the references I mentioned below.

Another point I would like to convey is that the notes do not contain all of the course materials. As I mentioned
before, these notes are subjective and in some places only the parts I needed necessary were taken.

Finally, you can find the notes in PDF format under
the [pdf](https://github.com/egemenzeytinci/data-science-notes/tree/main/pdf) folder in bulk.
