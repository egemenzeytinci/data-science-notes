### Data Science Notes

#### Introduction
This repository contains notes about the machine learning, various tools for data science and big data.

First of all, I'd like to point out that these notes can be subjective because I took them while reading, 
listening or watching the course materials. You can find the references I mentioned below.

Another point I would like to convey is that the notes do not contain all of the course materials. 
As I mentioned before, these notes are subjective and in some places only the parts I needed necessary were taken.
